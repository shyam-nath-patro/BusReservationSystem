# 🚌 Bus Reservation System

A full-stack **Bus Reservation System** developed as a **Database Management Systems (DBMS) Capstone Project**. The application manages passengers, buses, conductors, and ticket information using a MySQL database with a Node.js backend and a responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Bus Reservation System is designed to simplify transportation management by maintaining passenger, bus, conductor, and ticket records in a centralized relational database. It provides complete CRUD functionality, dashboard statistics, SQL-based reports, and a user-friendly interface.

This project demonstrates core DBMS concepts including relational schema design, normalization, primary and foreign keys, SQL queries, views, joins, aggregate functions, and report generation.
